# Eventual

Welcome to Eventual, an opinionated Infrastructure as Code Platform. The goal is to provide similar
mechanics for cloud infrastructure that O/RMs provides for databases. Define your solution using
code with sensible default conventions and let Eventual discover your solution architecture,
scaffold the infrastructure, allocate resources, and deploy your code wired according the layout
you defined.

# Sensible Defaults with Customization

Eventual is opinionated, there is a pit of success that the platform gravitates your code toward.
You define your application in terms of Queries, Events, Commands, Sagas, and EventHandlers.
Eventual will create the resources to support your solutions, deploy your code and wire it
according to your specification.
